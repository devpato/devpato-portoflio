        <div class="intro">
          I am a Software Engineer. I am very passionate about what I do
          especially when it comes to code. I have participated in several
          hackathons and won TWO of them. I love learning new things in general,
          but I am always trying to learn a new technology online or from other
          people. I believe the ability to listen and communicate with others is
          one of the keys to be successful in this career.

          <div class="sub-title">Helping others.</div>
          I love helping others. You can catch me on stackoverflow helping
          people with their questions, helping people on social media helpin
          them land a developer job. I have also created tutorials for the
          company where I work. The tutorials are diverse. Some of those
          tutorials are on best practices, Angular, CSS, and more.
